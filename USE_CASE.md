# AppDynamics VMWare - Monitoring Extension

VMware vSphere ([www.vmware.com](http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vsphere/overview.html)) is a cloud computing virtualization operating system. The VMWare extension gets statistics from the VSphere server and displays them in the AppDynamics Metric Browser.

This extension works only with the standalone machine agent.
